        Hello There, I am a 1st year Software Engineering Bsc student at
         Nottingham Trent University. I am originally from Felixstowe, 
         Suffolk which is where I grew my love for computers and sports.
         I have been playing in sports since I was very young as my father
         was an avid cricketer. Nowadays, my main sport is field hockey where
         I play for the NTU 1st Team. I am also a keen road cyclist. These not
         only help me keep fit and fuel my competitive spirit but also develop 
         my ability to work in a team (from hockey) and my perserverence from 
         cycling and pushing through pain when riding solo.
      </p>

      <p class='description'>
        During my time at NTU I have been apart of the Men's Hockey club
        training 3 times a week (2 pitch sessions and 1 Gym session), also
        playing matches on Wednesdays and Saturdays. This has helped me better my ability to work in a team and developed
        my ability to cope under pressure to make the right decisions.

      <p class='description'>
      I have been completing a series of online course and exercises related to programming and problem
      solving to aid my progress in the course. I have been using a couple of platforms, Hackerrank and Codecademy
      to do this. I have also taken some courses on Time managment and Sports Psychology to help me in 
      day to day life.
